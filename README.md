# Activity-Creater-KDE

# Objective 
To create a temporary activity and delete it when activity is stopped

# Packages needed

zenity-For getting user input in gui

# How to use it
- Make a custom shortcut that runs the script called create
- Make another custom shortcut that runs the script called stop.This is your stop activity shortcut

When the shortcut is used 
It creates an empty activity called e1 when it is pressed first.
When u press the shortcut again it asks the activity number, 
this time if you enter 2 it creates a new activity called e2,
if you give 1t switched to e1 activity.

Like-wise u can have upto infinite activites
